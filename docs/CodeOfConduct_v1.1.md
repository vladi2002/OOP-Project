##Code of Conduct

In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary.


**Assignment description:**

In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group in this course.

We need to make a quiz that runs on a local server that can support multiple games. We have to create a client side and server side to support this. The quiz game is about guessing various trivia questions relating to energy consumption. It can be played single player and multiplayer.

**Target or ambition level:**

What grade are you working for?

We’re all looking for around an 8.

**Products:**

What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)? What standards must the work submitted meet?

We deliver a functioning quiz game, the standards met are discussed further in the backlog. All official documentation is on Gitlab, and will be submitted there when it needs to be referenced, and we communicate through a combination of Gitlab, Mattermost, and Whatsapp.

**Planning:**

How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submits it to Brightspace *on behalf of the project group?*

We’ve decided on one person (Detti) that is going to upload everything necessary on Brightspace, and thus she has the final say on behalf of the group. Everyone has agreed to merge/push all of their code to Gitlab on Monday (before the meeting), as well as any other necessary files for the meeting. Each person should work a minimum of 10 hours per week.

Furthermore, the issues will be formatted according to the template found in the docs file, and will be labelled appropriately. Before any new issue is started, a corresponding

merge request will be created and linked to it. All communication about the code including revisions will be done through the merge request. 

**Behavior:** 

How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?

Handling disagreements can be done through a democracy system. In case of a bigger disagreement we’ll involve the student TA as mediator, or as a third party. We agree to treat each other with respect and kindness. If someone is late they have to bring food.

**Communication:**

In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? (in the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)

We communicate through the scheduled meetings every Tuesday (and informally every Thursday). We also communicate in an official capacity through Gitlab, otherwise we discuss through Whatsapp and Mattermost.

**Commitment:**

How do you determine the quality of each group's work, so that each group delivers the same quality? 

How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?

Chairs and minute takers can receive feedback at the end of each meeting. The minutes of each meeting will contain a checklist that can hold us accountable for the work that we have done/intend to do. Determining the quality of work will be done through Gitlab, where comments on work can be made to those that did it.

**Meetings:**

How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings? 

We’ll meet twice a week, once formally on Tuesdays, once informally on Thursdays. Preparation will need to occur for Tuesday's meeting, where the chair should make the agenda, and everyone should upload their work before the meeting.

**Decision-making:**

How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

We’ll make decisions by majority vote. If the vote is even, we debate. No bribing, no corruption.

**Dealing with conflicts:** 

How do you handle conflicts within the group?

Have a civil discussion. If that doesn’t work we consult the TA.

**Guidance:**

What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?

For matters relating to the course, the TA can be consulted. For matters relating to the actual task itself, we can figure this out among ourselves.

**Consequences:**

What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?

If someone doesn’t keep the agreement, we can discuss it as a group. If someone doesn’t keep the agreements more than two times, we ask the TA about what to do.

**Successfactors:**

What makes your team a dream team?

We communicate well. We’re cool. We’re determined. Our group has a variety of individual strengths and interests that we intend
on using to our benefit.
